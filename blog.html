            <p>Forged in the fires under the grills and fryers of the restaurant industry from age 15.
                Trained in the inclusive, non-judgmental culture of NPR. Most recently refined by the stressors of training consumers over the phone.
                A thirst for new knowledge, aptitude for maintaining composure, and unflappable levity during high pressure situations makes for an unbeatable candidate.

                    <h3>Entree the First</h3>
                    <h4>bounty hunting, cosmic timing, bugs, lamentations</h4>
                    <p>So there's this saying floating around that fits the times pretty perfectly, <q>Born too late to explore the Planet and too early to explore space.</q>. 
                       Now recently the topic of Bug hunting was introduced which sparked all sorts of romanticizations. Only for certain <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bugbounty/comments/lca4pur/is_bug_bounty_dying/">reddit threads</a>
                       to be found shortly after. Obviously it is hard to mourn the loss of something never known but ways where found, and spirits were down. A short time later a different, 
                       more <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bugbounty/comments/lfh7u3q/is_bug_bounty_dead_2014_was_golden_era_500_for/">hopeful thread</a> was discovered, returning life to its former imaginative state
                    <br><br>
                    Other, unreferenced, insights were also found that led to a determination. Remember the Lawless Old West lasted much longer than most people would like to admit, 
                    and there's nothing about employment which bars having a hobby. Additionally, attempting to score a bounty can only expand skills&#8212;and possibly the ol' wallet&#8212;
                    while the job hunt continues. And so, onward continues the great trek into something new and challenging. Don't lose heart, the only true failure is staying down

                    <h3>Entree the Second</h3>
                    <h4>Teams, Hats, Intent, Compliance</h4>
                    <p>
                        White Hats use their powers for good, Black Hats for evil. Red Team is offensive, Blue Team is defensive, and Purple's a mix. But is that all there is? Where is the mythical
                         people's hero? Donde esta Zorro? Where is Robin of the Hood? Surely there must be a place for the <q>semi</q>-ethical hacker. The grey hatted, the green hooded, the domino masked scale balancer,
                         who whittles away at the wealth of the untouchable to the cheers of the underpaid. Does everyone just forget injustice to keep themselves afloat while paddling past the drowning
                          masses? Or does learning how to effectively secure any company, program, network or system truly show just how close the whole digital facade dances on the very edge of the rim,
                         and instead of risking complete collapse, contentment is found mending the fence&#8212;all else be damned.
